# CoNote : Final Report

## Quality Argument
There are some great features in our interface and we will explain why it is great. These are Mandatory Feedback and the note editor.

**1. Mandatory Feedback**

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mandatory Feedback is one of the most novel features of Conote. If a user hasn’t written feedback for any notes, the user can’t access to anyone’s note. The user has to provide the feedback for note selected by Conote system. After user gives enough numbers of feedback, then the user can access to every note.   
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This feature is necessary part of Conote. The most important driving force of Conote system is its mutual feedback system. Because of feedback, students would share their notes deliberately. So we have to make sure of minimal amount of useful feedback. The Mandatory Feedback is a good solution for this. This also prevents increase of freeloaders.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This feature is great for two reasons. First, this is really novel feature. Based on our team’s knowledge, there is no such feature implemented from current education services. Second, we designed this system in great detail. We designed mandatory feedback to be iterated in certain period, for example, one week. If mandatory feedback is all done on first week, no one would like to give another mandatory feedback after that week, which is not a situation we want. We also make the title of notes in need of mandatory feedback blinded. This is prevent feedback givers to have any bias on notes based on title and writer of the notes. And also, the minimal number of mandatory feedback also can be adjusted. These details make this feature great.  

**2. Note editor**

This is a screenshot of what our note editor can do, including text effects, table, lists and code.

Our note editor is a well-received features of Conote. Using our editor UI, user can write lecture note easily. According to user survey, note UI helps their task to fill in and upload lecture notes. Some users left comments that they wish our UI support chemdraw, which is chemical molecule drawer, and math expression.
